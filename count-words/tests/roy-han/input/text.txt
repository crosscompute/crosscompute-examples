runner's creed
12/7/2004
hit the wall, fall, rest, recover, get up, break through
desperately yes that is youth is love is life is don't forget what's at the bottom
don't mess everything or, if you have, then minimize damages
push forth the act of pushing forth is hope
hunt the good times they can't hide forever
run forward and live, win

invisible roads
12/25/2004
Each goal defines invisible roads on the rest of the world. Find and travel these roads, depending on the goals you choose.

my goals are my responsibility and
work smart to support and protect those I love.
