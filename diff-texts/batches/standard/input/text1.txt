MR COGITO TELLS OF THE TEMPTATION OF SPINOZA

BY ZBIGNIEW HERBERT
TRANSLATED FROM POLISH BY ALISSA VALLES

    Baruch Spinoza of Amsterdam
was seized by a desire to reach God

    in his attic while polishing
lenses
he suddenly pierced a veil
and stood face to face

    he spoke at length
(and when he spoke
his mind expanded
and his soul also)
he put questions
on human nature

    --God stroked his beard absently
    
    he inquired into the first cause
    
    --God looked off into infinity
    
    he asked after the final cause
    
    --God cracked his knuckles
cleared his throat

    when Spinoza fell silent
God spake

    --you're a good talker Baruch
I like your geometrical Latin
and the clarity of your syntax
the symmetry of your proofs
    but let us speak
of Things Truly
Great

    --look at your hands
scarred and shaking

    --you ruin your eyes
by sitting in the dark

    --you eat poorly
you dress badly

    --buy a new house
forgive Venetian mirrors
for reflecting surfaces

    --forgive flowers in the hair
the song sung by drunkards

    --manage your income well
like your friend Descartes

    --be cunning
like Erasmus

    --dedicate a treatise
to Louis Quatorze
he won't read it anyway

    --temper
the rational fury
it will topple thrones
and blacken the stars

    --think of
a woman
who will give you a child

    --you see Baruch
we speak of Great Things

    --I want to be loved
by the unlearned and fierce
for they are the only ones
who truly hunger after me

    now the veil falls
Spinoza is alone

    he sees no golden cloud
nor a light in the heights

    he sees darkness
    
    he hears a stair creak
footsteps going down
