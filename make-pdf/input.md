## Tips

- If you're not familiar with Markdown syntax or CSS styling, there are many online resources that can help you learn the basics. A good starting point is the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) and [Mozilla CSS tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
- The tool may not be able to handle every Markdown syntax or CSS style, so you may need to experiment a bit to get the desired results.
